# DiscordHelper

A python script to detect whether your discord was tempered with in any way.
## Functionnement

DiscordHelper will provide a fast analysis over known malwares and progress it's analysis toward a complete sha1 checksum comparison against a known good install.

If the integrity can't be verified, the helper will propose to upload a new database with all computed data (this functionnality is mostly useful if you have a custom/modded Discord).

# WARNING
Due to the evolutive nature of viruses, only a new, clean install of DiscordHelper will warranty a total detection of all threats, since a virus will always try to temper all methods of detecting it.

# DISCLAMER
While this program aims to provide a complete coverage over Discord Threats, there are many ways to temper with discord that cannot be covered in this program, mainly side-dll tempering and all forms of RAT and keyloggers. DiscordHelper cannot and will not try to analyse the rest of your operating system, we leave this intrusive behaviour to other AV.

## Security and trust
We highly encourage all users to check, or have someone check our code.
We do not analyse the content of your data, we do not send any data to our servers, 
and we do not try to temper in any way to your install, even to fix it.
